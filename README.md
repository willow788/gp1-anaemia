# 🩸 Anemia Detection using Machine Learning  

An AI-driven system designed to detect **anemia** from routine blood test parameters with high accuracy.  
This project uses classical machine-learning models, robust data preprocessing, and **explainable AI (SHAP)** for transparent clinical insights.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

The model predicts the likelihood of anemia based on laboratory values such as Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), and other derived indices.  
It aims to support general physicians by providing an early, data-driven risk assessment — bridging the gap between traditional diagnostics and intelligent automation.
